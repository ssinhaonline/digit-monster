# Digit Monster

Introduction
----
Digit Monster is a tool that offers easy prediction of handwritten numbers. It can be considered as a semi-productionized version of my [Digit Recognition Notebook][digit-recognition-notebook]. This project was heavily inspired by tutorials available at [PythonProgramming.net][python-programming-net-ml-tut1] and REST API in Python basics at [The Flask Mega-Tutorial][flask-mega-tutorial].

Usage:
----
Clone this repository:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ssinhaonline/digit-monster.git
```
Use conda package manager to create environment and install dependencies. If you don't have Anaconda, you can download it [here][anaconda-download].
```sh
$ cd digit-monster
$ conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
```
Run the training module.
```sh
$ /path/to/executable/bin/python train.py
```
Wait till the execution completes. Verify the following lines in your output:
```
Epoch 1/3
60000/60000 [==============================] - 4s 68us/sample - loss: 0.2613 - acc: 0.9226
Epoch 2/3
60000/60000 [==============================] - 4s 66us/sample - loss: 0.1079 - acc: 0.9667
Epoch 3/3
60000/60000 [==============================] - 4s 65us/sample - loss: 0.0728 - acc: 0.9778
10000/10000 [==============================] - 0s 30us/sample - loss: 0.1049 - acc: 0.9664
0.10489846243094653
0.9664
Model saved at: models/digit-monster.model
```
Start your Flask server:
```sh
$ /path/to/executable/bin/flask run
```
Verify server has started with the following lines in console:
```
* Serving Flask app "digit_monster.py"
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
POST to endpoint with CURL or Postman:
```
POST http://localhost:5000/digit-monster/v1.0/predict/
{
    "X" : [[["3D_IMAGE_ARRAY_SEE_EXAMPLE_BELOW"]]]
    "suggested_labels" : ["LABEL_ARRAY_SAME_SIZE_AS_X"]
}
```
Response format:
```
{
    "status" : "OK_OR_FAILED",
    "predicted_labels" : ["PREDICTED_LABELS"],
    "is_correct" : ["TRUE_OR_FALSE"]
    "message" : "INCLUDED_IF_STATUS_FAILED_OR_IS_NOT_CORRECT"
}
```

Examples
----

### One image, supplied with `suggested_labels` to test correctness
Payload includes a square 28x28 image of a handwritten 7 (dimension: 1x28x28). Each cell includes its corresponding pixel value. See image vectorization examples in my [Digit Recognition Notebook][digit-recognition-notebook]
